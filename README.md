# Health-Data-Regression-Analysis
This is a regression analysis project on Health-Data to determine the relationship between biking and smoking on heart health..

After loading the data, i checked to ensure that the data met the assumptions of Autocorrelation, Normality and Linearity.

I then performed the Linear regression analysis between the 2 independent variables(biking and smoking) and the independent variable(heart disease).

I then followed through by checking for homoscedasticity to ensure that my model is actually a good fit for the data. From the result obtained here, the residuals showed no bias, meaning that my model fits the assumption of homoscedasticity.

I then visualized my data by plotting the relationship between biking and heart disease at different levels of smoking, where i treated smoking as a factor with three levels, just for the purposes of displaying the relationships in my data.

From the reult of my analysis, i found a 0.2% decrease in the frequency of heart disease for every 1% increase in biking, and a 0.178% increase in the frequency of heart disease for every 1% increase in smoking.
